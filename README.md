# EdgeDetectionVisium

This function is designed to identify spots near the edges of the Visium box, tissue boundary, and tears in the tissue. 
These spots may have abnormally high or low counts that may skew downstream analysis and should be filtered out.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

  * If they aren't already installed and/or loaded, then the function will handle that for you
* If you wish to use a Seurat object to ensure that the order of the file matches, then load Seurat
